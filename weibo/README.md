## OAuth2.0

After setting up your [Open Weibo Account](http://open.weibo.com) and
registering for an application, you will receive `YOUR_APP_KEY` and
`YOUR_APP_SECRET`. Together with `YOUR_CALLBACK_URL`, these are the environment
variables required by sinaweibopy.

```python
from weibo import APIClient
    
APP_KEY = 'YOUR_APP_KEY'            # app key
APP_SECRET = 'YOUR_APP_SECRET'      # app secret
CALLBACK_URL = 'YOUR_CALLBACK_URL'  # callback url
```
Put on your website a link which redirect the user to the following
authorization URL:

```python
client = APIClient(app_key=YOUR_APP_KEY, app_secret=YOUR_APP_SECRET,
                   redirect_uri=YOUR_CALLBACK_URL)
url = client.get_authorize_url()    # redirect the user to `url'
```

After granting the privileges, the user will be redirected to
`YOUR_CALLBACK_URL`, with parameter `code=SOME_CODE` attached. Then you need to
get the access token using this `SOME_CODE`.

```python
r = client.request_access_token(SOME_CODE)
access_token = r.access_token  # access tokenï¼Œe.g., abc123xyz456
expires_in = r.expires_in      # token expires in
client.set_access_token(access_token, expires_in)
```

Then, you are free to call whatever API you like. For example,

```python
print client.statuses.user_timeline.get()
print client.statuses.update.post(status=u'test plain weibo')
print client.statuses.upload.post(status=u'test weibo with picture',
                                  pic=open('/Users/michael/test.png'))
```

## How to call a particular API

Firstly, refer to the corresponding API document. Use
[`user_timeline`](http://open.weibo.com/wiki/2/statuses/user_timeline/en) as an
example:

```
API:
statuses/user_timeline

HTTP Request Method:
GET

Request Parameters:
source:       string, This parameter is not needed when using OAuth. The value
                      of this parameter is the AppKey.
access_token: string, This parameter is required when using OAuth.You will get
                      the access_token after oauth authorization. 
uid:          int64,  Return the weibos of specified ID of a user. 
screen_name:  string, The nickname of the user that ID is specified. 
```

Substitute `/` in the API with `.`, and call `get()` or `post()` according to
the request method with all the necessary parameters excluding `source` and
`access_token`.

```python
r = client.statuses.user_timeline.get(uid=SOME_ID)
for st in r.statuses:
    print st.text
```

If the request method is `POST`, then it should be something like the following:

```python
r = client.statuses.update.post(status=u'test weibo')
```

And, as for uploading pictures:

```python
f = open('/Users/michael/test.png', 'rb')
r = client.statuses.upload.post(status=u'test weibo with picture', pic=f)
f.close()  # you need to do this manually
```

Please notice that what is uploaded must be a file-like object. str can be
wrapped using `StringIO`.
